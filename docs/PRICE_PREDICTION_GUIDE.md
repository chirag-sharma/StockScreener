# Price Prediction Feature - User Guide

## üéØ Overview

The Stock Screener now includes advanced **Price Prediction** capabilities that provide 30-day forward price targets using multiple analytical methods. This feature is seamlessly integrated into both the unified screener workflow and available as a standalone tool.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Multi-Method Price Prediction
1. **Technical Analysis**: Moving averages, trend analysis, support/resistance
2. **Fundamental Analysis**: DCF approximation, P/E valuation, Graham formula
3. **Machine Learning**: Linear regression and random forest models (when scikit-learn available)
4. **Time Series**: ARIMA modeling (when statsmodels available)  
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Price pattern and momentum analysis
6. **Volume Analysis**: Volume-price relationship analysis
7. **Ensemble Method**: Combines all methods with weighted confidence scoring

### AI-Enhanced Integration
- Price predictions are automatically integrated into AI analysis
- Enhanced AI prompts include price prediction context
- Target price recommendations consider both fundamental and technical factors

## üìä Output Columns Added

The screener now includes these additional columns in Excel reports:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Predicted Price (30d)** | 30-day forward price prediction |
| **Price Change %** | Expected percentage change |
| **Prediction Confidence** | Confidence score (0-100%) |
| **Prediction Method** | Method used for prediction |
| **Target Price** | AI-enhanced target price (combines prediction + analysis) |

## üé® Integration with AI Analysis

### Enhanced AI Prompts
The AI analysis now receives price prediction context:

```
PRICE PREDICTION ANALYSIS:
Current Price: ‚Çπ1367.80
Predicted Price (30 days): ‚Çπ2881.31
Expected Change: 110.6%
Prediction Confidence: 37.0%

ENHANCED ANALYSIS REQUIRED:
1. How the predicted price movement aligns with fundamental analysis
2. Whether current valuation supports the predicted direction
3. Risk factors that could impact prediction accuracy
4. Timeline considerations for achieving target price
```

### Improved Target Price Accuracy
- Combines fundamental valuation with technical momentum
- Considers recent news and market developments
- Provides confidence-weighted recommendations

## üìã Prediction Methods Explained

### 1. Technical Analysis

3. **Market Risk**: Stock markets are inherently unpredictable
4. **Accuracy Limitations**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
5. **External Factors**: Predictions don't account for unexpected market events

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Custom Prediction Models
You can extend the `PricePredictionService` class to add your own prediction methods:

```python
from stock_screener.services.pricePrediction import PricePredictionService

class CustomPredictor(PricePredictionService):
    def _custom_prediction_method(self):
        # Your custom prediction logic
        pass
```

### API Integration
Use JSON output for integrating with other applications:

```python
import json
from stock_screener.services.pricePrediction import get_batch_predictions

symbols = ['RELIANCE.NS', 'TCS.NS']
results = get_batch_predictions(symbols)
print(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

The system tracks prediction accuracy and provides confidence scores based on:
- Historical model performance
- Market volatility
- Data availability
- Method consensus

Higher confidence scores indicate more reliable predictions based on multiple confirming methods and stable market conditions.
