1. based on previous data, perform a linear regression to predict the next value, and some other things can
//    be done with the data, like plotting it, etc.
// 2. use the data to train a model, and then use that model to predict the next value
but this would require a lot of data, and the model would need to be trained on a lot of data
and will be different from what I am trying to build here, but it is a good idea to keep in mind
